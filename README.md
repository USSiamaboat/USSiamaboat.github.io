# Web Portfolio

This is the 2025 revision of my web portfolio.
Hopefully, this will last me at least as long as the previous one.

There are a few areas that I'm particularly happy that I fixed with this revision:
- Finally found a nice animation to put at the very top
- A slightly more matured (hopefully) design without the excessive pagination and card nesting I struggled with earlier
- Solved some genuinely challenging CSS problems inherent to my ambitious (read: I forgot that I also had to implement) design

However, there are still some minor technical issues, which I will do my best to track using Github Issues on this project's repo.
I accomplished some incredible amounts of procrastination while making this, so I had to push this to main at a slightly lower polish than I would have liked in order to make time for other commitments.

That's all. Thanks for stopping by!
